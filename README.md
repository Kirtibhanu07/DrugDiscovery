# DrugDiscovery
### Train and Test partition. Patient reviews on specific drugs along with related conditions and a 10 star patient rating reflecting overall patient satisfaction. ###
## Dataset: **Kaggle: 	 UCI ML Drug Review dataset:**

Our architechture for this project revolves around the reviews, upvotes and condition for a particular drug.The Drug Review dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository provides patent reviews on specific drugs along with related conditions.Our aim is to predict the health disorders from the patients' conditions & recommend drugs for those disorders. We also provide the best drugs for a given condition based on the users' reviews. This system would assist the physician with the diagnosis.

# Conclusion:
	1. We are able to provide top 5 drugs used and their ratings for 800+ conditions.
	2. With 3400+ drugs in our dataset, we are able to provide alternatives.
	3. We were able to predict the sentiment of patients based on drug reviews.
	4. We were able to see that, as the length of the review increases, the usefullness also increases.
	5. We also could find a trend that over the 10 years period, there's an increase in drug usage as well as the number of health conditions reported.

# Future Work:	
	1. Remove Duplicate Drug Name (Display only unique Medicine Names)
	2. Detailed information about medicine (info like: Usage, Side Effects, Dosage, etc)
	3. Add other conditions and medicines.
	4. Find Alternative and notify user for drug interaction problems (A person on blood thinners should not be given aspirin, ibuprofen, and naproxen can make you bleed more. Even common products like Pepto-Bismol can cause bleeding )
	5. Gather patient Data and provide Feedback form.
